## Explanation of progress

I appreciate this wouldn't usually be the place to give my life story, however it felt more
appropriate to scrutinise my progress here than in a long-winded email to be sent via HR. <br />
The project is not complete and is missing the ability to take advantage of the special offers. Ordinarily,
if I was struggling, I would ask someone on the team for help rather than going
around in circles as I did with this - however it felt unsportsmanlike to do so in this situation, given
it was an interview task and the only React developers I know would likely be checking over
the finished product.
I am lucky the squad know me, and know I’m proactive in what I do and will do my best to figure out the answers to things myself, but I’m not the sort of person to sit around mulling over an issue for so long it becomes detrimental to the teams’ progress on a ticket. <br /><br />
I feel the part of this that let me down wasn't necessarily my abilities with React, but the fact that the requirement (the mathematics) isn’t something I’ve had to do before even in a language which I am more comfortable with. I do understand that to get the special offer price you need to work out how many items
are eligible for the offer price, i.e 3, 6 or 9 A's - I would then use a modulus to work out the remainder in
order to give those items the non-offer price. After much head-scratching and back and forth to the laptop thinking "Oh, I'll
just try this" whilst also trying to balance looking after a baby with a partner who is
 working full-time on a CDL ops team, I decided it was better to cut my losses, submit what
I had, and rather than just send a half-finished attempt, take the time to explain it. <br /><br />
Given that my limited exposure to React before applying for this role was such a long time ago, I was
essentially starting from scratch with this project. As soon as I applied for the role I began a pluralsight
course [React: Getting Started](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/react-js-getting-started/table-of-contents),
and this certainly helped me in getting to grips with what I needed to do for this Kata, and in the interest of full
disclosure I did have to look up some examples and tutorials for shopping carts to work out what to do. <br />
I am frustrated to
have missed the point of the Kata, however I'm also very pleased with the progress I did make, especially
starting from scratch in a new language <br />
Failure to solve the Kata aside, I really enjoyed working with React and Redux, state management isn't
something I've done very much of and I was pleasantly surprised with how easy it was to get to grips with it
and how seamless the integration is. I am certainly going to continue learning more and developing larger,
more complex applications to test myself. <br /><br />
I would be interested to see an example of how the problem should have been solved if there is one available to be shared.


## Readme

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
